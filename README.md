# mangaplace - api

## ( this project is still under development )

- desc: this uses comick api's backend and exposes better endpoints.

## roadmap

### first checkpoint
- test out every endpoint using curl and see if you are able to get images and pdfs
- write a few functions that will give you the pdf if you give the name of the manga or something
- just write a switch statement to get the geners and popular ones and get option to download chapters and shit
- if this all are working you can go to next phase
